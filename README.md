eInk display HUD for various things running on a raspberry pi

The idea is to have an eInk display on a raspberry pi that will update with bitcoin prices, weather, tindie orders and other data that can be put on display to get an idea of things that need to be done when waking up in the morning. 

Things to possibly display:
    Crypto
        Bitcoin
        Possibly others with way to change between multiple
    Tindie Orders
    Weather
    Google Calendar events
